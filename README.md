# PlatformARPG

Took this up as an attempt to start learning Python in preparation of a class next semester. Picked this as an idea from GitHub's Game Off
2018. Liked the theme of hybrid. Started gaming on platform games like Mario, and still to this day like ARPG ever since I started
playing Diablo. 

Unfortunately the month has been very busy with school as the semester is wrapping up. But do plan on getting something playable at some 
point.
